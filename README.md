# Physics-Project-cpp
Repository with small projects whose goal is to make physical simulations.
## 1st Project: Free Fall
In Free Fall, you have a command line interface where you can input the initial height of the object and the axis' orientation, in order to tell you what is the time until the object's reaches the ground.
`freeFall.exe` is in `freeFall/x64/debug`.
### Warning!
We assume, that the air resistance is negligeable.
